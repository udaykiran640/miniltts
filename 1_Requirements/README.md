# Real-estate Advisor

# Requirements
<br>

## Introduction

* Real-estate advisor helps people to connect each other for buying and selling of their properties. It is a modern way to buy or sell the properties. Buyers are one click away to get the information of all type of properties that are in and around them and the sellers can register their properties by providing the specificatons of their property.

* This makes real-estate globalised. Traditional way of business takes more time but in case of real-estate advisor time barrier is removed because the buyer and seller can access at any time.

## Research

 * Real-estate is one of the major business which requires a high attention. While doing the research I found that mediators play a vital role in closing a deal.

* Mediators take a huge amount of money on successful completion of a deal. To overcome this real-estate advisor helps buyer to connect directly to the customer without any mediator. This decreases the burden to buyer and seller too.

* Time is also a barrier. In order to meet a person to view the property, the buyer's only source is mediator so it takes more time to view the property.


## Real-estate advisor has advantages and a disadvantage too.

### Advantages 
* 24/7 Accessability
* Time saving
* Saves money
* No mediator
* Easy access

### Disadvantage
* There can be fraudsters who might keep fake information. So the two parties (Buyers and Sellers) need to be very particular in checking the proofs.
